#Ex 2
#Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string.
#(It is true that Python has the len() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

def length(string):
    count = 0
    for i in string:
        count += 1
    return count


#if __name__ == "__main__":
print length("test string")
print length([1,2,3])
